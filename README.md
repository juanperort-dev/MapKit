# 🗺 MapKit SwiftUI App

> 📍 An interactive iOS app developed with **SwiftUI** and **MapKit**, allowing users to explore multiple locations on a map, view rich details, and navigate between them easily.

---

## 🧩 Features

- 🗺️ Display of custom locations using Apple’s MapKit
- 🖼️ Image and detail view for each point of interest
- 📍 Tap-to-focus and navigation between locations
- 📚 SwiftUI-based architecture with modular code organization

---

## 🧑‍💻 Tech Stack

- `SwiftUI`
- `MapKit`
- `MVVM` pattern
- `Xcode 15+`
- (No persistence used)

> 🔍 *This project was built as a personal learning challenge to explore Apple’s MapKit framework from scratch and integrate it into a functional SwiftUI app.*
